# 3D-Tensor-Sub-Region-Sum-Finder
3D Tensor Sub-Region Sum Finder
Description

This project is a C++ program that processes 3D tensors. It reads tensor data and a target sum from input files and calculates the number of sub-tensors (subregions) within the tensor that match the specified target sum. The program is designed to handle sparse tensors with non-zero elements specified in the input files.

Features

Reads input from text files to construct a 3D tensor.

Supports sparse tensors with non-zero values specified in the input.

Computes and counts sub-tensors matching a target sum.

Outputs the results, helping analyze specific subregions of the tensor.
